This project is an ALX interview question based on Rotate 2D Matrix
The question is:
Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.
Prototype: def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place.
You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
